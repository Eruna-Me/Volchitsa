An old chess engine I originally wrote by following some (but not all to my own demise) of the instructions of Bluefeversofts programming a chess engine in C tutorial series: LINK 
Which was my first significant step in learning programming.

It currently builds succesfully on Windows with Visualstudio. Haven't tested whether it still works on Linux yet, will do so in the future. 
It has some significant bugs at the moment.

Most code is original but it contains pieces of modified Vice code.
Special thanks to Bluefeversoft and the Chessprogramming wiki, without their instructive material I wouldn't have known how to program a chess engine.
